                        <p>
                        So first up we have been instructed to take two personality tests so the we can assess and learn more about ourselves, on how we react and see the things in the society, and on what group of people can I be compatible with. First test was from https://www.16personalities.com/<br><br>

                        • First category is MIND (this trait determines how we interact with our environment) based on the results, between being Extraverted and Introverted it shows that I am more Extraverted, meaning I am more incline in interacting than being alone. <br>

                        • Second Category would be the ENERGY (this trait shows where we direct our mental energy) the results shows that I am more intuitive than observant. This means that I tend to think more than observe things.<br>

                        • Third Category is NATURE (this trait determines how we make decisions and cope with emotion) I tend to depend on my feelings on dealing with these kind of stuffs.<br>

                        • Fourth Category would be TACTICS (this trait reflects our approach to work, planning and decision-making) out of 100% I got 57% on Judging this basically means that I judge every work, plan and decision i would make.<br>

                        • Fifth Category is IDENTITY (this trait underpins all others, showing how confident we are in our abilities and decisions) show says I am more Turbulent than Assertive.
